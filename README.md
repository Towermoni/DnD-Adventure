# DnD-Adventure
Text-Based adventure game I created for my final for my Visual Basic's class


HOW TO PLAY:
1. Choose your class : Classes determine your starting attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Intelligence) and starting HP.
2. The higher the number the more effective the attribute is
3. Once your class is chosen and you have created a name for your character select "Continue" to start the game
4. In the text-Box you will be given a scenerio in which you can choose from a selection of options in how you will respond
5. Each Option you can choose from will have a attribute listed I.E ( STR, DEX, Int) signifying that that option is effected by the chosen skill.
6. When you have chosen which option you want type in the Corresponding number (1,2,3) into the text-box and press enter
7. The text-box will output the outcome which is determined whether how effective your attribute is and how lucky you get.
8. IF SUCCESSFUL : You will gain XP. Reaching 1000 xp will level you up, giving you additional health and the ability to increase one of your attributes by 1. There is also the chance you will recieve either armor or a weapon.
9. IF NOT SUCCESSFUL: No xp gain and a potential loss of HP, loot, or attribute points
10. Weapons will help you in combat scenerios. A weapon has two attributes, Damage and Critical. Damage represents the base points your weapon adds to your combat rolls while critical, if you get a critical success roll, will multiply the base damage by the critical modifier.
11. Armor will reduce the amount of damage recieved from failing scenerios

EXAMPLE OF PLAY:

1. Artemis the Paladin walking through a dark corridor comes across a barricaded door
2. He has 3 options

  1. Attempt to break through the door (Str)
  2. Lockpick the door (Dex)
  3. Yell for someone on the other side to open the door (Cha)
 
3. Artemis's player, after reviewing his atrributes, sees that he has 3 points in Strength, 1 point in Dex, 1 point in Intelligence, and 2 points in Charisma. Artemis decides that since Strength has the most points it would be the most effective; additionally, he can add the 3 damage points from his longsword to the strength roll.
4. The player enters a "1" in the text-box and selects enter.
5. In order to be successful, Artemis needs to roll a 7 or higher on his strength roll inorder to break through the door. On his roll he rolls a 2, he then adds his strength attribute of 3 points then adds his Longsword damage of 3, to a grand total of 8. The check passes and Artemis is able to break through the barricaded door.
6. Breaking through the door, Artemis finds a Greatsword on the other side which he replaces his longsword with.
7. Artemis gains 250xp and continues on to the next scenerio.
